# Takedown workflow

This readme is for workflow of DMCA Takedown request.

---

## Method of takedown

- [Open a draft security advisory](https://github.com/01101sam/Comfortable-Youtube/security/advisories/new) (**Faster**, *confidential*)
- [Write a letter to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/dmca-takedown-policy#submitting-a-takedown-notice) (**Slower**, *disclosed to GitHub staff*)

## After submitted

Once you have submitted a takedown request, I will be notified, and will take down the project by doing the following steps:
- Make the project archive and rewrite the readme to notify everyone about the takedown (*Once viewed and verified ownership*)
- Remove any related parts about this project from other platforms (*Immediately after verified ownership*)
- Convert all related repository to private (*After 12 hours*)
- Delete all related repository and forks (*by GitHub staff when using first method, by chance*)

### Note

_For the first method, it's not possible to takedown all related forks,
\
you may need to write a letter to GitHub about this._

_But the first method is the fastest way to take down this project, I recommend you to do both if necessary._

## Exceptions

I may reject your request if:
- This project can be continued by removing the infringing part(s)
- You are not the a legal representative of Google / YouTube
- There's a mistake in your request and cause GitHub misjudge the request when using the second method (See [this blog](https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back))
